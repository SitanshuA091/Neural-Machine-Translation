# Neural Machine Translation (NMT) Project

This repository contains a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) project implemented in Python. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`NMTranslation.ipynb`) that demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a French-to-English translation model using sequence modeling techniques. The model includes Luong attention and scaled dot-product attention mechanisms.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate Python files corresponding to the cell blocks in the original notebook. Each file focuses on a specific part of the translation pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

### Files

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for loading and preprocessing the French-English sentence pairs.
- `model_architecture.py`: Defines the architecture of the translation model, including the encoder, decoder, and attention mechanisms.
- `training.py`: Includes the training loop and functions for training the NMT model.
- `evaluation.py`: Contains functions for evaluating the model's performance on the validation and test sets.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used throughout the project.

### Notebooks

- `NMTranslation.ipynb`: The original Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the complete process.
