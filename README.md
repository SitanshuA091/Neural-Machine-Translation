# Neural Machine Translation (NMT) Project

This repository contains a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) project implemented in Python. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`NMTranslation.ipynb`) that demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a French-to-English translation model using sequence modeling techniques. The model includes Luong attention and scaled dot-product attention mechanisms.
